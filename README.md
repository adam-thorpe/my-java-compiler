# my-java-compiler
Welcome to my Final Year Project. 

This is a project that I am working on for my final year at university. My goal is to create a Java compiler with limited functionality (see [specification](Specification.txt)). 

Test cases of fully working code can be found in the [/bin](/bin)) directory.

The project uses maven and should be fairly simple to setup. Feel free to have a look around or give any suggestions :)
