# my-java-compiler
Welcome to my Final Year Project. 

This is a project that I am working on for my final year at university. My goal is to create a Java compiler with limited functionality (see [specification](Specification.txt)). The project uses maven and should be fairly simple to setup. Feel free to have a look around or give any suggestions :)
